This project outputs a fractal as an image in `output.png`. The source code of this project
was taken from [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/concurrency/threads.html#draw-fractal-dispatching-work-to-a-thread-pool).

This is my first project in Rust, so I looked upon various resources to make this project.
